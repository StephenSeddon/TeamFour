            <h3>Background</h3><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Web Design:<br>My coding background is mostly self taught essentialy using trial and error dating back to the days where everyone had a MySpace just because it was cool at the time. Ripping other peoples skins and then rewriting them was my first experience with CSS and HTML.<br>After that it peaked my interest and I started to look at building my own website.</li><br>
                    <li>
                        Programming:<br>Prior to coming on this Codenation course my only background was Java which I didn't set out to learn.<br>I played Minecraft on a friends server which was glitchy and offered to host it for him (better bandwidth). I enjoyed the game but got bored and played on another server that eventualy shut down and I took over that also... Then I was asked for plugins and after looking what other people had made I agreed and started to make my own aswell as paying 3 other people to work with me on other projects. 
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Now we move on to the CodeNation part</h3><br>
            When this course was suggested to me it was implied it was a 3 week web developing course, this wasnt the case, however a few good things came out of this course... While i would have turned down this course had I known what I was signing up for this is what happened:<br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>While I did struggle with python I now want to continue and progress.</li><br>
                <li>Everybody in our class has been amazing and I have learned a lot in a short time.</li><br>
                <li>We were put in teams and i knew whichever team got me did draw the short straw, however both of my team mates were so supportive and did make me feel included throughout the process. (I am so happy With our Project).</li><br>
                <li>When It comes to the web design I found this the easiest part (you wouldn't think so looking at this website) as I said I had prior experience I only had to learn to do it the way our tutor instructed.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            <h3>Summary</h3><br>
            <ul>
                <li>This wasn't actually supposed to look like a bad movie script. I had other plans for this page.</li><br>
                <li>I would just like to write here that I enjoyed this past 3 weeks and I am excited now that I can see a new way forward outside ofthe care sector, what started off as a hobby has become a realistic career goal.</li><br>
                <li>Massive thanks, to CodeNation and our two tutors. Everything was explained perfectly.</li><br>
                <li>Also a massive thanks, to my two team mates I enjoyed that whole process.</li><br>
                <li>Finally a shout out to everyone that was on the course I have learned lots from them and I am sure I have enough empty beer cans to throw at anyone that doesnt stay in touch after this course ends.</li>
            </ul>
